### üö® **CRITICAL QUALIFICATION MISMATCH EXIT LOGIC FIX**
- [x] **IDENTIFIED QUALIFICATION EXIT FAILURE**: Candidates with 2 years experience (vs 3+ required) were proceeding to scheduling instead of conversation termination
- [x] **ANALYZED ROOT CAUSE**: Multiple issues - experience gap threshold too high (2+ years), Exit Advisor not decisive enough about 1-year gaps
- [x] **LOWERED EXPERIENCE GAP THRESHOLD**: Changed from 2+ years to 1+ years to catch candidates with 2 years experience vs 3+ required
- [x] **ENHANCED EXIT ADVISOR DECISIVENESS**: Updated qualification assessment rules to be more decisive about experience gaps
- [x] **ADDED CRITICAL DECISION RULES**: Exit Advisor now ends conversations for 1+ year gaps without compensating factors
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED QUALIFICATION-SPECIFIC EXIT EXAMPLES**: Added specific examples for 2-year experience candidates
- [x] **ENHANCED CANDIDATE PROFILE CONTEXT**: Exit Advisor now receives detailed qualification assessment data for better decisions
- [x] **FIXED PROACTIVE QUALIFICATION RESPONSE**: Updated experience calculation in proactive qualification feedback to show correct years

### üìÖ **CRITICAL SCHEDULING PREFERENCE MISMATCH FIX**
- [x] **IDENTIFIED SCHEDULING MISMATCH**: Agent saying "12:30 PM" but offering slots at 9:30 AM and 9:00 AM (outside candidate's 12pm-2pm availability)
- [x] **ANALYZED ROOT CAUSE**: Preference matching logic only looked for exact date matches instead of time range matches across multiple days
- [x] **ENHANCED TIME RANGE DETECTION**: Added logic to detect "every day between X and Y" patterns and match any day within time range
- [x] **IMPROVED PREFERENCE MATCHING**: System now properly matches slots within candidate's specified time windows (12pm-2pm) across all available days
- [x] **PRIORITIZED PREFERENCE OVER DIVERSITY**: When preference matches exist, system now prioritizes time accuracy over slot diversity
- [x] **FIXED SLOT SELECTION LOGIC**: Slots are now filtered to only show times that match candidate availability before applying diversification
