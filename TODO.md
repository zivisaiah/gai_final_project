# Project Roadmap

## In Progress

## Planned
- [ ] Test Clarity API integration (more metadata, retries)
- [ ] Narrative Analysis
- [ ] Fine-tuning `ExitAdvisor` for better intent detection
- [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for all agent interactions

## Completed
- [x] Initial project setup
- [x] Modular refactor: scraper, enricher, serializer, utils
- [x] Implemented unified, LLM-based scheduling intent analysis
- [x] Replaced keyword-based candidate info extraction with LLM-based approach
- [x] Fixed proactive scheduling flow to correctly parse LLM decisions and offer time slots
- [x] Resolved critical parsing, state management, and proactivity bugs in `CoreAgent`
- [x] Fixed post-confirmation slot offering issue (agent no longer offers more slots after user confirms)
- [x] Fixed Streamlit method error by replacing non-existent `parse_candidate_time_preference` call
- [x] Enhanced chat interface with clickable time slot selection buttons for better UX
- [x] **MAJOR**: Replaced heuristic slot confirmation detection with intelligent LLM-based analysis (SchedulingAdvisor now uses CONFIRM_SLOT decision type with conversation context instead of error-prone string patterns)
- [x] **UI FIXES**: Resolved duplicate slot display and slot selection errors
  - [x] Fixed CoreAgent to not include formatted slots in text response (UI handles slot display via buttons)
  - [x] Fixed SchedulingAdvisor.book_appointment() to properly handle slot_id requirement for database
  - [x] Updated Streamlit slot selection to pass correct slot_id to booking method
  - [x] Verified appointment booking works correctly with proper database constraints
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Fixed "No Slots Available" Dead-End Conversation Issue
  - [x] Implemented progressive scheduling failure handling in CoreAgent._handle_no_slots_available()
  - [x] **Step 1**: Ask for flexibility when no slots match preferences (instead of endless promises)
  - [x] **Step 2**: Offer specific alternative times from available slots
  - [x] **Step 3**: Gracefully exit conversation if repeated scheduling fails
  - [x] Enhanced ExitAdvisor to detect scheduling failure patterns (multiple flexibility requests, repeated promises)
  - [x] Added 25+ evening slots to database for "after 4pm" requests
  - [x] Prevents infinite "I'll find slots" loops - now provides concrete solutions or graceful exit
