    - [x] Solution: Moved slot selection detection outside user_input block with higher priority
    - [x] Verified: Slot selection now processes correctly regardless of chat input state
  - [x] **DEAD-END CONVERSATION FIX**: Fixed critical issue where agent made scheduling promises without delivery
    - [x] Root cause: CoreAgent decided SCHEDULE but SchedulingAdvisor returned NOT_SCHEDULE, keeping original response with empty promises
    - [x] Solution: Added response override when scheduling intent is low - generates continuation responses that ask for availability instead of making promises
    - [x] Updated prompts: Removed scheduling promises from few-shot examples and system prompts
    - [x] Added explicit prompt instructions forbidding scheduling promises without delivery (defensive strategy)
    - [x] **ELIMINATED KEYWORD-BASED EXTRACTION**: Removed deprecated keyword-based sentiment analysis from prompts file

      - [x] Ensured pure LLM-based candidate information extraction throughout the system
      - [x] Updated tests to validate LLM prompt generation instead of keyword matching
      - [x] Maintained architectural consistency: prompts files now contain only LLM prompts, no logic
    - [x] Verified: Agent now asks for availability information instead of making empty promises like "I'll check our calendar"
    - [x] **ENHANCED SLOT DIVERSIFICATION**: Implemented intelligent slot selection across different days and times
      - [x] Created _diversify_slot_selection method with 3-phase selection algorithm
      - [x] Phase 1: Smart day+time selection - prioritizes different days AND rotates time blocks (morning/afternoon/evening)
      - [x] Phase 2: Add different time blocks on existing days if needed
      - [x] Phase 3: Fill remaining slots with any available options
      - [x] Applied diversification to all slot selection points in scheduling advisor
      - [x] Enhanced logging to show slot diversity across days and time blocks
      - [x] **IMPROVED TIME DIVERSITY**: Enhanced algorithm to vary times across different days
        - [x] Groups slots by day for intelligent day+time selection
        - [x] Rotates through time blocks (morning ‚Üí afternoon ‚Üí evening) across days
        - [x] Tracks global time block usage to prevent all morning/afternoon slots
        - [x] Tested: Now suggests optimal diversity like "Monday 9 AM, Tuesday 2 PM, Wednesday 6 PM"
        - [x] **FIXED SLOT COUNT ISSUE**: Ensured SCHEDULE decisions always return 3 diversified slots
          - [x] Modified _parse_unified_response to override LLM slot suggestions when decision is SCHEDULE
          - [x] Fixed streamlit_main.py to use diversification instead of available_slots[:3]
          - [x] Now guarantees 3 diverse slots regardless of LLM suggestion quality

      - [x] Updated analyze_conversation() to set current_conversation_history before running agent
      - [x] Verified: Tool functions now work correctly without parameter mismatch errors
    - [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed OpenAI temperature parameter restrictions for all agents

      - [x] Solution: Added _create_safe_llm() method with fallback temperature handling to all agents (ExitAdvisor, CoreAgent, SchedulingAdvisor)
      - [x] Graceful fallback: Attempts requested temperature first, falls back to default (1.0) if unsupported
      - [x] **FINAL FIX**: Changed default temperature in settings from 0.7 to 1.0 to prevent configuration errors
      - [x] Updated hardcoded temperature values in ExitAdvisor default parameters and tests
